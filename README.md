# Autoencoders/Transfer Learning
For this project, we are using the fashion MNIST dataset. It is divided into supervised and unsupervised sets. The supervised dataset is used to build a CNN model which will be used as the base model of a second CNN model (transfer learning) and compare metrics between the two of them. 
The unsupervised set will be used to build an autoencoder. Then, this autoencoder will be a reference to denoise a prepared set of the same images.
